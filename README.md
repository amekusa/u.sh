# SHLIB v1.0.0
A collection of utility libraries for shell scripting

Written by [@amekusa](https://github.com/amekusa)


## Features
- Customizable function prefix
- Does not load the same library twice
- Supports caching to minimize loading overheads


## INSTALLATION
Install as a git submodule:

```sh
git submodule add https://github.com/amekusa/shlib.git
```

Initialize/Update submodule:

```sh
git submodule update --init
```


## USAGE
```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
. shlib/load util     # Load util lib
. shlib/load util io  # Load util & io libs
```

By default, all the functions are prefixed with `_(underscore)`.
If you don't like it however, it can be changed to whatever you like with `--prefix` or `-p` option:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
. shlib/load --prefix 'my_' util  # Prefixise util with 'my_'
. shlib/load -p 'my_' util io     # Prefixise util & io with 'my_'
```

Then, all the functions in the specified libraries are renamed to have the specified prefix instead of `_`.


### OPTIONS LIST
```
--prefix <prefix> : Custom prefix for functions (default: '_')
--p <prefix>
--verbose, -v     : Output debug messages
--cache, -c       : Enable cache (default: true)
--no-cache        : Disable cache
--cache-ttl <sec> : Cache lifespan (default: 3600) (Negative number means infinity)
```
